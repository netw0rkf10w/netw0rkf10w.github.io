# Welcome

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the [Center for Visual Computing](http://cvn.ecp.fr/)
of CentraleSupélec and the [GALEN](https://www.inria.fr/en/teams/galen) research team of INRIA Saclay. I am advised by Professor [Nikos Paragios](http://cvn.ecp.fr/personnel/nikos/) and my research interests are in optimization methods for graphical models applied to Computer Vision.
